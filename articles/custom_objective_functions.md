# Custom Objective Functions and Advanced Options for Optimisation in speed

## Introduction

While the `speed` package provides a range of excellent default
optimisation settings for most experimental designs, researchers may
need to customise the optimisation process for specific requirements.
This vignette demonstrates how to:

- Create custom objective functions for specialised optimisation goals
- Adjust simulated annealing parameters for better performance
- Handle complex constraints and specialised design requirements  
- Monitor and control the optimisation process
- Troubleshoot optimisation issues

Understanding these advanced features allows researchers to fully
leverage the `speed` package for complex or non-standard experimental
design challenges.

``` r
library(speed)
```

## Understanding the Optimisation Process

### Simulated Annealing Basics

The `speed` package uses simulated annealing, a probabilistic
optimisation algorithm that:

- Starts with an initial design layout
- Proposes modifications (treatment swaps, moves)
- Accepts improvements and sometimes accepts worse solutions
- Gradually reduces acceptance of worse solutions (“cooling”)
- Converges to an optimised layout

### Default Optimisation Objectives

The package’s default objectives typically focus on:

- **Minimising treatment adjacency** - reducing neighbour effects
- **Maintaining spatial balance** - even treatment distribution
- **Respecting design constraints** - block structure, replication
- **Optimising statistical efficiency** - improving precision

### When to Customise Optimisation

You may consider custom optimisation when:

- Specific neighbour relationships are more important than others
- Non-uniform field conditions require weighted optimisation
- Complex constraints aren’t handled by default settings
- Multiple competing objectives need balanced consideration
- Performance tuning is needed for large or complex designs

## Custom Objective Functions

### Understanding Objective Function Structure

Objective functions in `speed` typically follow a standard structure:

- **Input**: Current design layout and associated data
- **Process**: Calculate penalties or scores for the input layout
- **Output**: Single numeric value (lower = better for minimisation)

Custom objective functions are a powerful way to tailor the optimisation
process to the unique requirements of your experiment. While the default
objectives in `speed` are designed to handle a wide range of common
scenarios such as minimising neighbour effects, balancing treatments
spatially, and respecting block structures, real-world experiments often
present additional or alternative priorities. For example, you may need
to:

- Enforce strict replication or co-occurrence rules for treatments
- Optimise for specific spatial or agronomic constraints
- Balance multiple objectives simultaneously (e.g., efficiency and
  logistics)
- Incorporate domain knowledge or experimental goals not captured by
  default settings

In these cases, writing a custom objective function allows you to
explicitly define what constitutes a “good” design for your context.
This flexibility is especially valuable for advanced or non-standard
designs, or when you want to experiment with new optimisation
strategies.

### Motivating Example

A classic example of a case where the default objective function doesn’t
capture all the design constraints is a *Balanced Incomplete Block
Design* (BIBD), where each treatment appears in a fixed number of
blocks, and every pair of treatments occurs together the same number of
times. Achieving this balance is critical for valid statistical
inference, but it can be challenging to obtain such a layout, especially
for large or complex experiments. Due to the number of constraints
involved, there are specific and limited combinations available for the
layout of the design, and the default objectives may not be sufficient
to guide the optimisation process towards a valid BIBD layout.

By writing a custom objective function, you can directly penalise
deviations from the BIBD requirements such as unequal treatment
replication or unequal co-occurrence of treatment pairs, thus guiding
the optimisation towards a valid or near-optimal BIBD solution. The
following example demonstrates how to structure such a function and
integrate it into the `speed` optimisation workflow.

### Writing a Custom Objective Function

Let’s now walk through the process of building a custom objective
function for a Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD). We’ll break down
the logic behind each part of the function, show how to implement it in
R, and discuss how it addresses the key requirements of a BIBD. This
example will illustrate how you can translate design constraints into
code, and how to use your custom function within the `speed`
optimisation workflow.

#### Constraints

A BIBD has the following properties:

##### Characteristics:

- Each treatment appears in exactly $r$ blocks
- Each block contains exactly $k$ treatments
- Each pair of treatments appears together in exactly $\lambda$ blocks
- Perfect balance but limited parameter combinations

##### Parameters:

- $v$ = number of treatments
- $b$ = number of blocks  
- $r$ = number of blocks containing each treatment
- $k$ = number of treatments per block
- $\lambda$ = number of blocks containing each pair of treatments
- $bk = vr$ and $\lambda(v - 1) = r(k - 1)$

Most of constraints can be handled by careful design of the layout and
the default objectives in `speed` package, such as minimising neighbour
effects and ensuring spatial balance. However, the co-occurrence of
treatments is more complex and requires custom handling.

#### Custom Objective Function Implementation

Firstly, we need to create a function that evaluates the co-occurrence
of treatments in the design. The function will count the number of times
each pair of treatments appears together, and simply return a list of
the counts. This will also help us to check if the design meets the BIBD
requirements later.

``` r
get_cooccurrence <- function(design_df, swap) {
  pairs <- unlist(lapply(unique(design_df$block), function(block) {
    combn(
      sort(as.character(design_df[design_df$block == block, swap])),
      2,
      FUN = function(x) paste(x, collapse = ",")
    )
  }))
  
  as.list(table(pairs))
}
```

Given an input data frame `design_df` with a column for blocks and a
column for treatments, this function will return a list of treatment
pairs (provided in the column given by the `swap` argument) and their
counts across the blocks. Now we need to incorporate this into a custom
objective function that uses this to evaluate the BIBD properties. To be
able to include it within the `speed` optimisation algorithim, we need
to ensure that the function returns a list with a `score` element, which
is a single numeric value representing the optimality of the layout. The
`speed` package is set up to minimise this score, so lower values are
better, and may require taking the reciprocal of the score if higher
values mean more optimal layouts in the context of a custom objective
function.

``` r
bibd_objective_function <- function(
    layout_df,
    swap,
    spatial_cols,
    row_column = "row",
    col_column = "col",
    ...) {
  
  adj_score <- calculate_adjacency_score(layout_df, swap, row_column, col_column)
  bal_score <- calculate_balance_score(layout_df, swap, spatial_cols)
  
  pairs <- get_cooccurrence(layout_df, swap)
  pair_bal_score <- var(as.numeric(pairs))
  
  return(list(
    score = round(adj_score + bal_score + 10*pair_bal_score, 10)
  ))
}
```

This function follows a very similar structure to the [default objective
functions](https://biometryhub.github.io/speed/reference/objective_functions.html)
in `speed`, but it adds a specific penalty for the co-occurrence of
treatments. The `get_cooccurrence` function is called to calculate how
many times each pair of treatments appears together, and the variance of
these counts is used as a penalty term in the final score. As
increasinly more treatment pairs appear the same number of times
together, the variance of the pairs co-occurrence decreases, becoming
more optimal. The `10*pair_bal_score` term is a weight that can be
adjusted based on how important the co-occurrence balance is relative to
the adjacency and balance scores. This function could be further
customised to include additional penalties or adjustments based on
specific design requirements, however the current implementation
provides a solid foundation for optimising a BIBD layout. Also, given
that custom objective functions are user-defined, they don’t require the
same level of error-checking as the default functions, so we can keep
the implementation relatively simple.

### Using the Custom Objective Function

Now that we have our custom objective function, we can use it in the
`speed` optimisation process. The `speed` package allows us to specify a
custom objective function using the `objective_function` argument. We
also need to ensure that our layout data frame has the necessary columns
for blocks, treatments, and spatial coordinates.

The following parameters will allow us to produce a valid BIBD layout:

- `v` = 5 (number of treatments)
- `b` = 10 (number of blocks)
- `k` = 3 (number of plots per block)
- `r` = 6 (number of replicates of each treatment)
- `lambda` = 3 (number of times each treatment appears together)

#### Setting Up the Design Data Frame

We will create a data frame representing the BIBD layout, and then run
the `speed` optimisation with our custom objective function.

``` r
# Create the data frame
bibd_df <- initialise_design_df(items = 5, nrows = 3, ncols = 10, 
                                block_nrows = 3, block_ncols = 1)

head(bibd_df)
#>   row col treatment row_block col_block block
#> 1   1   1        T1         1         1     1
#> 2   2   1        T2         1         1     1
#> 3   3   1        T3         1         1     1
#> 4   1   2        T4         1         2     2
#> 5   2   2        T5         1         2     2
#> 6   3   2        T1         1         2     2
```

The `initialise_design_df` function creates a data frame with 5
treatments, arranged in 10 blocks, with each block containing 3 plots.
The `block_nrows` and `block_ncols` parameters define the layout of the
blocks.

Figure 1: Initial BIBD Layout

[Figure 1](#fig-bibd-layout) shows the initial layout of the BIBD
design. The treatments are systematically assigned to blocks, but we
need to randomise this design, and ensure that the co-occurrence of
treatments meets the BIBD requirements.

#### Performing the Optimisation

Now we can run the optimisation using our custom objective function
simply by passing the name to the `speed` function via the
`obj_function` argument. We will also specify the `swap` argument to
indicate which column contains the treatments, and the `spatial_factors`
argument to include the block, row, and column information for spatial
balance. This will allow the optimisation to consider both the adjacency
of treatments and their spatial distribution across the blocks, while
the custom objective function will ensure that the co-occurrence of
treatments is balanced according to the BIBD requirements. Note also
that we set `optim_params(random_initialisation = TRUE)` to ensure that
the initialisation of the design is randomised.

``` r
result <- speed(bibd_df, 
                swap = "treatment",
                spatial_factors = ~ block + row + col,
                obj_function = bibd_objective_function,
                optimise_params = optim_params(random_initialisation = TRUE),
                seed = 42)
#> row and col are used as row and column, respectively.
#> Optimising level: single treatment within whole design 
#> Level: single treatment within whole design Iteration: 1000 Score: 7 Best: 7 Since Improvement: 425 
#> Level: single treatment within whole design Iteration: 2000 Score: 6 Best: 6 Since Improvement: 888 
#> Level: single treatment within whole design Iteration: 3000 Score: 6 Best: 6 Since Improvement: 1888 
#> Early stopping at iteration 3112 for level single treatment within whole design

result
#> Optimised Experimental Design

#> Score: 6 
#> Iterations Run: 3113 
#> Stopped Early: TRUE 
#> Treatments: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 
#> Seed: 42
```

``` r
autoplot(result)
```

![](custom_objective_functions_files/figure-html/bibd_result-plot-1.png)

``` r
get_cooccurrence(result$design_df, "treatment")
#> $`T1,T2`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T1,T3`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T1,T4`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T1,T5`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T2,T3`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T2,T4`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T2,T5`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T3,T4`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T3,T5`
#> [1] 3
#> 
#> $`T4,T5`
#> [1] 3
unique(unlist(get_cooccurrence(result$design_df, "treatment")))
#> [1] 3
```

Visual inspection of the plot and the output above shows that each
treatment appears exactly 3 times together as required. Hence we have
successfully used our custom objective function to generate a type of
design that is not possible with the default objective functions.
