# Optimise Experimental Design Layout Using Simulated Annealing

Optimises the spatial layout of experimental designs using simulated
annealing to minimise treatment adjacency and maintain treatment balance
across spatial factors. Works with regular or irregular spatial designs.

## Usage

``` r
speed(
  data,
  swap,
  swap_within = "1",
  spatial_factors = ~row + col,
  grid_factors = list(dim1 = "row", dim2 = "col"),
  iterations = 10000,
  early_stop_iterations = 2000,
  obj_function = objective_function,
  swap_all = FALSE,
  optimise = NULL,
  optimise_params = optim_params(),
  quiet = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing the experimental design with spatial
  coordinates

- swap:

  A column name of the items to be swapped (e.g., `treatment`,
  `variety`, `genotype`, etc). For hierarchical designs, provide a named
  list where each name corresponds to a hierarchy level (e.g.,
  `list(wp = "wholeplot_treatment", sp = "subplot_treatment")`). See
  details for more information.

- swap_within:

  A string specifying the variable that defines a boundary within which
  to swap treatments. Specify `"1"` or `"none"` for no boundary
  (default: `"1"`). Other examples might be `"block"` or `"replicate"`
  or even `"site"`. For hierarchical designs, provide a named list with
  names matching `swap` to optimise a hierarchical design such as a
  split-plot. See details for more information.

- spatial_factors:

  A one-sided formula specifying spatial factors to consider for balance
  (default: `~row + col`).

- grid_factors:

  A named list specifying grid factors to construct a matrix for
  calculating adjacency score, `dim1` for row and `dim2` for column.
  (default: `list(dim1 = "row", dim2 = "col")`).

- iterations:

  Maximum number of iterations for the simulated annealing algorithm
  (default: 10000). For hierarchical designs, can be a named list with
  names matching `swap`.

- early_stop_iterations:

  Number of iterations without improvement before early stopping
  (default: 2000). For hierarchical designs, can be a named list with
  names matching `swap`.

- obj_function:

  Objective function used to calculate score (lower is better) (default:
  [`objective_function()`](https://biometryhub.github.io/speed/reference/objective_functions.md)).
  For hierarchical designs, can be a named list with names matching
  `swap`.

- swap_all:

  Logical; Whether to swap all matching items or a single item at a time
  (default: FALSE)

- optimise:

  A list of named arguments describing optimising parameters; see more
  in example.

- optimise_params:

  Parameters used to control the behaviour of simulated annealing
  algorithm. See
  [`optim_params()`](https://biometryhub.github.io/speed/reference/optim_params.md)
  for more details.

- quiet:

  Logical; if TRUE, suppresses progress messages (default: FALSE)

- seed:

  A numeric value for random seed. If provided, it ensures
  reproducibility of results (default: `NULL`).

- ...:

  Other arguments passed through to objective functions.

## Value

A list containing:

- **design_df** - Data frame of optimised design

- **score** - Final optimisation score

- **scores** - Vector of scores across iterations (for simple designs)
  or named list of score vectors (for hierarchical designs)

- **temperatures** - Vector of temperatures across iterations

- **iterations_run** - Total number of iterations performed

- **stopped_early** - Logical indicating if optimisation stopped early
  (for simple designs) or named logical vector (for hierarchical
  designs)

- **treatments** - Vector of unique treatments (for simple designs) or
  named list of treatment vectors (for hierarchical designs)

- **seed** - Random seed used for reproducibility of the design. If not
  set in the function, the seed is set to the third element of
  `.Random.seed`.

## Details

This function provides a very general interface for producing
experimental designs of different types. For hierarchical designs such
as split-plots, strip plots, split-split plots and similar nested
structures, the key arguments (`swap`, `swap_within`, `iterations`,
`early_stop_iterations` and `obj_function`) can be provided as named
lists where each name corresponds to a level in the hierarchy (e.g.,
"wholeplot", "subplot"). When these arguments are provided as named
lists with matching names, the optimisation is applied sequentially at
each hierarchical level, starting with the first level and progressing
through the hierarchy. This allows for different optimisation parameters
and objective functions to be applied at different levels of the design
structure. For simple (non-hierarchical) designs, these arguments can be
provided as single values. For more examples and detailed usage, see the
package vignettes.

## Examples

df <- data.frame(

  col = rep(1:5, each = 4),
  treatment = rep(LETTERS[1:4], 5)
)

# Optimise the design
result <- speed(df, swap = "treatment", seed = 42)
#> row and col are used as row and column, respectively.

#> Level: single treatment within whole design Iteration: 1000 Score: 1 Best: 1 Since Improvement: 275

#> Early stopping at iteration 2725 for level single treatment within whole design 
autoplot(result)
